	<p>Hi, Iâ€™m Bridget Costa. I am a graduate of UConn Digital Media and Design currently working as an Associate Designer of Motion Graphics for ESPN.
		</p>
		<p>My passion for motion graphics began during my career as a gymnast, for which a true understanding of physics and aerodynamics is a key element to success. I noticed many of the laws of physics followed in gymnastics are transferrable to the 12 principles of animation. From there, I have been growing as a designer through applying an ever-evolving understanding of real physics to the fabricated world of motion graphics, and further how to portray motion in static design.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Here you will find a collection of my work, both motion design as well as graphic design.</p>
